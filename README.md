Immigration is a major component of American history and still proves to be a divisive topic today. While
some immigration debates revolve around customs and culture, many others focus on jobs and the workplace.
Despite these numerous debates, there is a lack of discussion about skilled immigrant workers specifically.
The Office of Foreign Labor Certification (OFLC) within the US Department of Labor publishes raw data
which provides many details about foreign workers in the country. For example, in 2015 there were
approximately 1 million people who obtained lawful permanent resident status. Two of the most useful sets
of data provided by the OFLC are PERM and Prevailing Wage. Additionally, there is data available related
to the H1B visa which is commonly used by foreign workers. Exploring this data has uncovered insights that
shed some light on the current status of immigration. One notable result is that permanent residents earn
more on average than the median US income. The analysis in this report is important because the topics it
covers are rarely discussed and there is a distinct lack of research in this area. Overall, this project provides
an understanding of where skilled immigrants are coming from, where they are settling, and the type of jobs
they are doing.
